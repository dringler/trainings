    "The wikipedia article of regression testing provides a good overview to the topic of testing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing.\n",
    "In addition check Andreas Müller's github repository for his \"Applied Macine Learning\" course at Columbia university (https://github.com/amueller/COMS4995-s19). The lecture about testing can be found at: https://github.com/amueller/COMS4995-s19/blob/master/slides/aml-02-python-git-testing/index.html.

    "## What is testing?\n",
    "\"Regression testing is re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change. If not, that would be called a regression. Changes that may require regression testing include bug fixes, software enhancements, configuration changes, and even substitution of electronic components. As regression test suites tend to grow with each found defect, test automation is frequently involved.\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type of tests\n",
    "* \"**Unit tests:** function does the right thing\n",
    "* **Integration tests:** system/process does the right thing\n",
    "* **Non-regression tests:** bug got removed and will not be introduced\"\n",
